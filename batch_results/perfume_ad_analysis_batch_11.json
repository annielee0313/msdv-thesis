But you will find never a word of the aura of glamour that surrounded her. Perhaps, because such matters are too subtle entirely for the mundane pen. Time and again in these Mayfair rendez-vous you've been conscious of that sudden catching breath of brilliance an elusive sparkle that seemed to characterize some lovely creature as poignant, beautiful, wist-fully perfect and divinely gay. That's when you recognized the spell of Yardley's formal Fragrance perfume. And made a note to trace it down and have it for your own some day. Now you need not go to London to surround yourself with this charmingly sophisticated brilliance. For now America has Fragrance by Yard-ley, London's smartest perfume also. As well as Fragrance powder, a great perfumer's contribution to your skin's per-petual radiance. (In subtle colors, it is soft and very lasting.) Will you go on explor-ing... and have the bath salts, and pow-der, tale, compact in the same entrancing fragrance? If you're perfectionist enough, it's what you're bound to so we've placed them all (at no great price) nearby at your disposall At any fine cosmetics counter for sparkling occasions when you want to sparkle tool",
