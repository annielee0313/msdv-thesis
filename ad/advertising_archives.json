As well as Fragrance powder, a great perfumer's contribution to your skin's per-petual radiance. (In subtle colors, it is soft and very lasting.) Will you go on explor-ing... and have the bath salts, and pow-der, tale, compact in the same entrancing fragrance? If you're perfectionist enough, it's what you're bound to so we've placed them all (at no great price) nearby at your disposall At any fine cosmetics counter for sparkling occasions when you want to sparkle tool"
